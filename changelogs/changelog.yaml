      major_changes:

          server. The ``nomad.service`` unit starts a Nomad server while the

      minor_changes:
        - |-
          install - The role can now only proceed with the binary installation
          without setting up the environment. This can also be used to install
          application plugins.

          nomad_driver_podman - Add a role to install and configure the
          `Podman <https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/plugins/drivers/podman>`_

          specify where Nomad is to find its configuration files.
